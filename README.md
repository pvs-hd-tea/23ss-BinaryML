## BinaryML : Classifying Binaries for Malware and Vulnerability Detection

The main goal of this project is to combine and improve best machine learning approaches for detection of malware and vulnerabilities based on binaries.

#### Objectives
  1. Comprehensive Literature Review and Comparison.
  2. Identification and Prioritization of Best Approaches.
  3. Cross domain code transfer: Bridging the Gap between Vulnerability and Malware Detection.
  4. Evaluation on Real Binaries and Benchmarking!
 
##### Two security detection models for malware and vulnerability domains make up the majority of this project. For more information and setup, see the readme files in the respective directory.
